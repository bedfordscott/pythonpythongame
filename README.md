Snake Game
A simple Snake game in Python using the tkinter module for the GUI.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The snake will move continuously in the current direction until you change its direction using the arrow keys.

The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. When the snake eats food, it grows longer and your score increases.

The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body. Try to beat your high score!
